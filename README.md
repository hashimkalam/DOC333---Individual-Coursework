# DOC333---Individual-Coursework
You have been instructed to develop a simple shapes calculator!

The shapes calculator must be created using the python language. There must be options to calculate the specific required choice to the type of shape. 

**First** - surface area of the cone --> Surface Area = (pi*radius*radius) + (pi*radius*slant height)

**Second** - volume of the cone --> V = 1/3* (pi * radius * radius) * height

**Third** - base area of the cone --> Base Area = pi*(radius*radius)

**Fourth** - volume of the rectangular pyramid --> Volume = (length*width*height)/3

**Fifth** - surface area of the rectangular pyramid --> Surface area = (length*width) +length*((((width/2) *(width/2)) +(height*height)) **0.5) +width*((((length/2) *(length/2)) +(height*height)) **0.5)

A report is needed to be submitted with the following contents in it!

1. Problem
2. Problem understanding
3. Algorithm
4. Test cases for each operation
5. Along with the screenshots of the program runned!
